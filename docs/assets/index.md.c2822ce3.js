It&#39;s an adorable collection of original <strong>pixel art portraits</strong>. They are <strong>Bitcoin native tokens</strong> with a reservation system on Ethereum in order to make the mint and transfer as easy as possible for you and <strong>provably random</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="Banner"></p><h2 id="claim-details" tabindex="-1">Claim Details <a class="header-anchor" href="#claim-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li>Allocated to nested OnChainBirds &amp; Enigmatic Box holders first (snapshot taken), unclaimed will go to other on-chain NFT communities (like OnChainMonkey, Moonbirds).</li><li>Direct mint on Bitcoin handled by us, Ethereum only used to collect addresses, fees and randomization.</li><li>Claim window will not be open for very long (TBA).</li><li>0.006 eth per mint + gas (to cover Bitcoin fees and possible fluctuations)</li><li>After all 10k are reserved on Ethereum, the Bitcoin mint will be automated and start shortly after.

The art is unique and nothing you have seen before, creating an identity and community first established on Bitcoin.<br> We also believe the process of buyers setting up their own Bitcoin Wallet is an excellent learning process that anyone who wants to hold Bitcoin Ordinals should go through and enjoy.</p><h2 id="can-i-see-the-art" tabindex="-1">Can I see the art? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-see-the-art" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We might show some sneak peeks when we are close to collecting all reservations. It will be best though to keep the art as a surprise and ensure that you will own the first ever inscription of it.<br> Yuga&#39;s Twelvefold for example got front run by people recreating the art and inscribing them before Yuga. As Inscriptions don&#39;t rely on smart contracts, the provenance and importance of inscribing something first is even higher than on Ethereum.<br> The art is very high quality and original 24x24 pixel art. It has a very unique style and is not a derivative.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Banner"></p>',10),l=[s];function h(c,d,m,p,u,g){return a(),i("div",null,l)}const _=t(r,[["render",h]]);export{b as __pageData,_ as default};
