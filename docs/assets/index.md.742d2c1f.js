It&#39;s an adorable collection of original <strong>pixel art portraits</strong>. They are <strong>Bitcoin native tokens</strong> with a reservation system on Ethereum in order to make the mint and transfer as easy as possible for you and <strong>provably random</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="Banner"></p><h2 id="claim-details" tabindex="-1">Claim Details <a class="header-anchor" href="#claim-details" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Claim Details&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Allocated to nested OnChainBirds &amp; Enigmatic Box holders first (snapshot taken), unclaimed will go to other on-chain NFT communities (like OnChainMonkey, Moonbirds).</li><li>Direct mint on Bitcoin handled by us, Ethereum only used to collect addresses, fees and randomization.</li><li>Claim window will not be open for very long (TBA).</li><li>0.006 eth per mint + gas (to cover Bitcoin fees and possible fluctuations)</li><li>After all 10k are reserved on Ethereum, the Bitcoin mint will be automated (~2 weeks).

The art is unique and nothing you have seen before, creating an identity and community first established on Bitcoin.<br> We also believe the process of buyers setting up their own Bitcoin Wallet is an excellent learning process that anyone who wants to hold Bitcoin Ordinals should go through and enjoy.</p><h2 id="can-i-see-the-art" tabindex="-1">Can I see the art? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-see-the-art" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I see the art?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We might show some sneak peeks when we are close to collecting all reservations. It will be best though to keep the art as a surprise and ensure that you will own the first ever inscription of it.<br> Yuga&#39;s Twelvefold for example got front run by people recreating the art and inscribing them before Yuga. As Inscriptions don&#39;t rely on smart contracts, the provenance and importance of inscribing something first is even higher than on Ethereum.<br> The art is very high quality and original 24x24 pixel art. It has a very unique style and is not a derivative.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Banner"></p>',10),l=[s];function h(c,d,m,p,u,f){return a(),i("div",null,l)}const _=t(r,[["render",h]]);export{w as __pageData,_ as default};
