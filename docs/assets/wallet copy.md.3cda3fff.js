Wait for other people to test and share their experiences. We are still very early. A reservation will send all tokens to one wallet and even if your wallet says they support transfers, it might only support transferring if there is only one NFT in the wallet.<br> This means that you may have to wait until wallet capabilities are upgraded before you can transfer your Bitcoin Cows. Therefore, do not expect a &quot;quick flip&quot; without the risks described above.</p>',10),o=[n];function s(c,d,h,p,u,w){return a(),l("div",null,o)}const y=r(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
