Wait for other people to test and share their experiences. We are still very early. A reservation will send all tokens to one wallet.<br> This means that you may have to wait until wallet capabilities are upgraded before you can transfer your Bitcoin Cows. Therefore, do not expect a &quot;quick flip&quot; without the risks described above.</p>',12),s=[n];function d(h,c,u,f,w,p){return l(),a("div",null,s)}const y=r(o,[["render",d]]);export{v as __pageData,y as default};
